            Our flagship product, the McKay Airway, is a proprietary medical device that has been shown in clinical trials to improve bag-mask ventilation 
            compared to an oropharyngeal airway, along with simplifing airway management in general. It reduces the technical skills and training required to
            keep a patient's airway open. The device is effective with both unconcious and awake patients.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our device is classified as a Class I medical device by Health Canada and the FDA and has successfully been used in trial procedures.
            Our latest clinical trial showed that using the device results in patients achieving stable ventilation 32% faster than an oropharyngeal airway.
            In addition, 94% of users stated that they outright prefered using the Mckay Airway over an oropharyngeal airway or had no preference between
            the two, with over half of those users expressing a preference for the Mckay Airway.

            <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32180174/">Description of a novel oral airway: the McKay airway</a>
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            This published report describes the McKay airway, a Health Canada class 1 medical device, designed to make bag-mask ventilation (BMV) 
            easier for beginners, novice users, and medical care workers who don’t use BMV in routine medical practice. The author describes 
            the major concerns with BMV using the traditional airway devices which are maintaining jaw thrust (by head-tilting and upward thrust 
            pressure on a supine patient), while simultaneously pressing downward the mask to maintain a perfect seal for bagging-a technique 
            commonly acquainted with experienced practitioners. With the McKay airway, resolves these concerns by maintaining jaw thrust during BMV, 
            so that the bagger can focus on mask seal pressure. A demonstration on how this is achieved using the McKay airway is displayed on 
            this video.

            <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32385826/">An exploratory study of the McKay airway to assist bag-mask ventilation</a>
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            This publication presents the results of a 3-month clinical trial investigating the length of time it takes to reach optimal oxygenation 
            via bag-mask ventilation (BMV) by novice bag mask users, using the traditional oropharyngeal (Guedel) airway device versus the novel 
            McKay airway device. Research results showed that the time it took to achieve optimal oxygenation via BVM was 32% faster with the 
            McKay airway compared with the Guedel airway. Other findings reported more preference for the novel McKay airway device, and easier to 
            use, than the Guedel airway.

            <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32314261/">Investigation of a novel oral airway for awake flexible bronchoscopy</a>
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            This study aimed to investigate and compare the length of bronchoscopy procedural time from insertion of fibreoptic bronchoscope 
            into airway to full visualization of vocal chords, in semi-conscious patients, using three airway inserts to facilitate bronchoscope 
            insertion. The three airway devices were, the McKay airway, the Williams airway, and a standard bite block. Results showed that using 
            the McKay airway, the respirologist recorded a shorter procedural time to full visualization of the vocal chords compared with the bite 
            block; but a little short compared with the Williams airway. Bronchoscopist’s commented in favour of the McKay airway regarding quality 
            of glottic view during procedure at 20% of the time compared with 1.4% for the bite block and 6% for the Williams airway. Similarly, 
            occurrence of patient gagging during procedure also reported in favour of the McKay airway at 1.4% compared with the Williams airway 
            at 20%. There were no reflex gagging incidents while using the bite block. Although gagging occurred once with a patient during the 
            study, it did not impede or preclude it’s use as the McKay doesn’t touch posterior pharynx as does the Williams airway.

            We're open to inquries about the device related to potential use cases, clinical efficacy, or potential business
            discussions. Samples are available by request.
